<h3>My coding journey</h3>
<p>
  HI! I'm stephany. I started coding in 2022 because i was looking for a career
  in tech after i found out how much i loved computers and all types of
  technology. I graduated early from highschool but didn't end up going to
  college at all. I taught myself everything i know. I learned a lot in the time
  i've been coding and i'm proud of how far i've come. I have learned multiple
  languages ; HTML, CSS. I appreciate you taking this time to look at my work
  and hope you love what you see.

<h3>About my life</h3>
<p>
  I grew up cristian and although i consider myself an atheist i still hold the
  values i grew up with close to me. I had a difficult relationship with my
  parents but i had an amzing dad that stayed by my side all those years. He
  worked very hard as all dads do , to provide for his family. I didn't end up
  going to college like the rest of kids but the differnce was that i took the
  time to learna new skill.I do what i do because i want him to see me become a
  wonderful and succesful young woman before he leaves my side.

<h3>Hobbies and things</h3>

<p>
  I game a lot as a hobby. I mostly play Valorant and Overwatch but i really
  enjoy survival games like raft, the forest, and minecraft (is it considered
  survival?). I like "horror" games as well but i appreaciate learning other
  games whenever i can. Apart from gaming i enjoy being outdoors. I used to go
  hiking a lot after i stopped my skateboarding adventure. I spend a lot of time
  with my husband outdoors doing things he likes. Fishing, kayaking, and we work
  on cars together. Maybe we will get to know even more about eachother in the
  future.
