<h1>The Best movies/shows According to Stephany</h1>
<h2>My top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Spirited Away</h3>
<p>super cute. it's my first ghibli studio film i watched and i loved it</p>
<h3>Scream series</h3>
<p>
  I am so sorry in advance but i dont know my favorite one yet. i am such a
  scream whore. i love the whole murder mystery thing going on and that its not
  just supposed to be jumpscares which i can find a little cringe
</p>
<h3>NANA</h3>
<p>
  it's not a movie but i fell in love with nana. An anime about life,
  relationships, and the intricacy of friendships between women
